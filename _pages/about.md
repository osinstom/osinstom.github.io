I'm primarily a R&D software engineer and solution architect with a research attitude. I specialize in software engineering, system design, and performance evaluation and optimization in the networking and telecommunications area.
I like to work at the intersection of research, innovation and engineering. So far, I have been working in such technical domains as Software-Defined Networking (SDN),
Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), distributed edge computing, 5G Core & RAN systems, network slicing, architectures and protocols for 3GPP mobile networks, data center networking, distributed cloud-native systems and Telco Cloud technologies.

My key expertise lay in the programmable and high-speed data plane processing for network systems.
In June 2023, I obtained a Ph.D. degree from Warsaw University of Technology in the discipline of Information Technology and Telecommunications.
My Ph.D. dissertation, entitled "Data plane programmability for software datapaths in the virtualized network infrastructure", proposed two novel
technologies for high-speed and programmable software-based packet processing. Throughout the Ph.D. studies I built strong expertise in
design and implementation of packet processing pipelines (including packet classification algorithms, stateful processing, rate-limiting, QoS, etc.),
OS-level packet processing techniques (e.g., RSS, TSO, LRO, etc.) or frameworks (e.g., eBPF/XDP, DPDK, AF_XDP), and programming abstractions for
packet processing (OpenFlow, P4, P4Runtime, eBPF). During my professional career I have also gained a deep technical knowledge and hands-on experience with
programmable switches (mainly P4-programmable Intel Tofino ASIC) and programmable NICs (Netronome Agilio SmartNICs, Intel IPUs, NVIDIA DPUs).

See my [projects](https://osinstom.github.io/projects/) and [professional career path](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomek-osinski) to learn more about my past and on-going activities.

I'm strongly driven by the internal motivation, but I always need to see a bigger picture and believe that the project I work on
has a clear and ambitious goal. Also, I'm always eager to meet new technical challenges that are in line with my personal career goals.
So far, I have successfully worked in different roles. I participated in the open-source projects (Floodlight, ONOS, ONAP, P4) as an individual contributor
developing parts of the system. As an R&D Expert at Orange Labs and Ph.D. candidate at Warsaw University of Technology I had opportunity to act as an independent researcher finding new paths and
driving the research activities (mainly in collaboration with other researchers). Also, I successfully led a team of 3-5 R&D software engineers for almost 3 years
as the R&D team leader at Orange, where I was responsible for research planning and strategy, system design, PoC delivery, engineering and driving a day-to-day work.
Since 2021 I've been a senior team member at Open Networking Foundation (until 2022) and Intel Corporation (until now), working as a software engineer on SDN, 5G and edge computing.

I believe in life-long learning. Thus, I'm a big fan (but not a freak!) of self-development. I always try to develop my talents.
According to the CliftonStrengths assessment developed by the Gallup Institute, my TOP5 talents are:

1. *Strategic* - I usually think long-term and strategically. I follow the process.
2. *Achiever* - I'm highly goal-oriented, purposeful and motivated.
3. *Relator* - I like to achieve my goals with people I know well. I like to feel that we follow the same goal as a group.
4. *Responsibility* - I feel obligated to finish projects I committed to.
5. *Significance* - I like to see a bigger sense and the end goal of projects. I always see opportunities to do more. I never aim at the minimum goal, always try to achieve more than average.
