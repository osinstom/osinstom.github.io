title: 5G!Pagoda H2020 program
description: I contributed to the 5G!Pagoda EU-Japan project realized under EU H2020 programme. 5G!Pagoda was a research project on network slicing for 5G networks. I was involved in designing a network slicing architecture and multi-domain NFV orchestration. Moreover, I had developed various prototypes of designed solutions based on OpenStack, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenBaton, Ansible and Juju.
